# The general format is that "local 0" implies creation of a master.
# Otherwise there is one line per slave.  The "1" is obligatory.
# The first field is the hostname or localhost (in a form valid for "rsh")
# The second field, 1, is obligatory.
# The format is inherited from MPICH, which grew from P4.

#Example:
# procyon.ccs.neu.edu 1 ./mygap4beta/bin/pargapmpi.sh
