make check TEST_FILE=gauss-elim-redo
./a.out --TOPC-safety=2
  in dist. memory mode
  often yields a bug with 2 or more slaves, but not always
  The master hangs after sending the REDO.  Only slaves 1 and 2
  are participating.
  There is one busy slave, and the rest are idle.

  To observe it in gdb, it's better to break at TOPC_master_slave and
    then continue.  More slaves seem to trigger the bug earlier.
