General Information
===================

This is version @TOPC_VERSION@ of TOP-C, last updated in @TOPC_UPDATED@.
TOP-C stands for Task Oriented Parallel C/C++.  It is a package that
allows one to easily write parallel C/C++ applications that tolerate
high latency, while running in a distributed memory (message passing) or
shared memory (POSIX threads-based) mode.

TOP-C hides the details of parallel programming, and presents the
application programmer with a simple task-oriented interface, for which
the application programmer need only define four callback functions.
Yet, TOP-C has been shown to readily adapt to a wide variety of algorithmic
requirements.

TOP-C has been tested and ran on recent versions of Linux/Intel, SUN/Sparc,
IRIX/SGI, AIX/IBM, and OSF/Compaq Alpha.
