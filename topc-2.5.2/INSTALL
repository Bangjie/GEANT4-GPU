The installation instructions follow the common model:
  ./configure
  make
  make install
The rest of the instructions are modified from those for the GTK+ package.

Simple install procedure
========================

  % gzip -cd topc.tar.gz | tar xvf -       # unpack the sources
  % cd topc                                # change to the toplevel directory
  % ./configure                            # run the `configure' script
  % make                                   # build TOP-C
  [ Become root if necessary ]
  % make install                           # install TOP-C

The Nitty-Gritty
================

The 'configure' script can be given a number of options to enable
and disable various features. For a complete list, type:

  ./configure --help
 few of the more important ones:

*  --prefix=PREFIX         install architecture-independent files in PREFIX
                           [ Defaults to /usr/local ]

*  --exec-prefix=EPREFIX   install architecture-dependent files in EPREFIX
                           [ Defaults to the value given to --prefix ]


Options can be given to the compiler and linker by setting
environment variables before running configure. A few of the more
important ones:

 CC       : The C compiler to use
 CXX      : The C++ compiler to use (needed only if application uses C++)
 CFLAGS   : C compiler flags

The most important use of this is to set the
optimization/debugging flags. For instance, to compile with no
debugging information at all, run configure as:

 CFLAGS=-O2 ./configure           # Bourne compatible shells (sh/bash/zsh)

or,

 setenv CFLAGS -O2 ; ./configure  # csh and variants

Installation directories
========================

The location of the installed files is determined by the --prefix
and --exec-prefix options given to configure. There are also more
detailed flags to control individual directories. However, the
use of these flags is not tested.

Two shell scripts, topcc and topc++, are created during the configure
process, and installed in the bin/ directory ($exec_prefix/bin).
These can be used as replacements for the configured values of CC and CXX
(where the values were set by ./configure) in compiling and linking
TOP-C applications.

Additionally, a shell script topc-config is created during the configure
process, and installed in the bin/ directory ($exec_prefix/bin). This
provides an alternate way for to determine the location of TOP-C libraries,
include files, and definitions that are needed when building TOP-C
applications.

If you move TOP-C after installation, it will be necessary to edit
topc, topc++ and topc-config.  The three scripts also contain
a --help command line parameter, which provides a brief synopsis
of their usage.
