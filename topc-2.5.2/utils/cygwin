scanf different  "%s%s "

1) src did not compile because of the redefinition of "struct option" in
   options.c. On the second try it compiled fine. I am not sure what the 
problem was but when I did configure from scratch src compiled fine. hmmmm

2) expand_path in procgroup.c core dumps. Read on the internet that sscanf 
in
   cygwin has a bug which prevents it from recognizing white space in the
   pattern if whitespace is in the end of the pattern. Like when pattern is
   " %*s %*s ", sscanf would not match whitespace at the end of the pattern.
   Thus  sscanf( path, " %*s %*s %n", &offset); would set offset to some big 
number because it does not find a pattern in the "path" variable.
   Solution was to replace  sscanf( path, " %*s %*s %n", &offset) with
   sscanf( path, " %*s %*s%n", &offset);
   suffix = path + offset;
   if (strlen(suffix)>0) suffix++;

3) There is a problem in the Makefile in the /bin directory. It assumes that 
output
   file of gcc is a.out, but on windows platform its a.exe, thus errors.

4) There is a problem in the manual for topc.
   In the section called "If Slaves Fail to Start", there is a simple 
program
   given as an example.

   #include "topc.h"
   int main(int argc, char *argv) {
   char host[100];
   printf("%s connecting ...\n", gethostname(host, 99));
   TOPC_init(&argc, &argv);
   printf("... %s connected.\n", gethostname(host, 99));
   TOPC_finalize();
   }

   The problem is with lines :
   printf("%s connecting ...\n", gethostname(host, 99));
   printf("... %s connected.\n", gethostname(host, 99));

   gethostname returns the status code and not the name of the host.


5) In the distributed mode, topcc fails saying:
    Socket died;  Not ready for writing.  Will try to create a new one.
    Socket died;  Not ready for writing.  Will try to create a new one.
    sendrecv.c(line 237): send: Bad address

    I am currently investigating this problem.
