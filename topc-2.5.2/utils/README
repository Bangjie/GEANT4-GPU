These are sketches of code to be polished and included in future versions
$of TOP-C.  They may also be useful in their current state.
They are:

ssh-killall:  Example:  `ssh-killall a.out' to kill runaway a.out on slaves
	This is a script that calls ssh-procgroup
ssh-procgroup.c:  Calls ssh on hosts in procgroup.  Looks for `procgroup'
	 in current directory.
	 To create binary, do:  gcc -o ssh-procgroup ssh-procgroup.c
	EXAMPLE:  ssh-procgroup killall -9 -v a.out
	          (to kill runaway slaves of name a.out, from previous run)
broadcast.c:  Implements broadcast() and gather() (and eventually scatter())
               on top of TOPC_master_slave().
topc.cc:  C++ interface replacing callbacks by an abstract class to be
          instantiated by an application
	  THIS DOES NOT COMPILE.  IT IS JUST AN ARCHITECTURE.
cygwin:   Comments on what to change to use this under Cygwin
recursion:  Notes on applying this to applications with recursion
checkpoint.c:  Planned integration of checkpointing
	  ./a.out --TOPC-checkpoint=DAYS (default is 1 day)
	  User declares restart fnc:  TOPC_checkpoint_restart(FNC);
	   FNC is executed at beginning of TOPC_master_slave
	   during restart and can fix up file descriptors, local vars on
	   stack, etc.
	   Use TOPC_is_master() if you don't want it in all processes
	FNC can be NULL, but user must type:  TOPC_checkpoint_restart(NULL);
