The total execution time of this test was 6:07 minutes
There are two main classes (and specific functions) that eat up the bulk of the processing time:

hadr04.cc
- As expected the hadr04 class eats up a total of 99.96% of all the execution time. This would be due to the fact that this classes main function
sets the run manager, and generally speaking, instantiates and calls all the functions needed for the example to run.

RunAction.cc
- The 

Run.cc
- 

Stepping Action.cc
- The constructor of this class accounts for 91.39% of the spike in processing time at the
