	G4NeutHP Example
==========================

The following Geant4 example was created to stress high precision neutron processes, 
specifically G4ParticleHPVector and the G4HPNeutronData data class.

The example was created as part of the Geant4GPU project, with the intended purpose 
of highlighting the performance increase given by enabling the aforementioned processes 
with GPU compatability. 

This readme was based on what was written for the Geant4 example "Hadr04".
