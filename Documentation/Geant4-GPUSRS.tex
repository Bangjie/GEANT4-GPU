\section{Project Drivers}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Purpose of Project} % Matt
\subsubsection{Project Background}
Physics researchers use software simulations to model how particles interact with environments, and to determine the effects of these interactions. Members of McMaster's Engineering Physics department use GEANT-4 -- a simulation toolkit developed by CERN. McMaster's researchers have developed their own fork of the software, G4-STORK, designed to study McMaster's nuclear reactor. Currently, running G4-STORK simulations (as well as other GEANT-4 simulations) that require many particles takes a long time to compute when run on the CPU. This limits researchers to smaller number of particles than are realistic, and prevents them from seeing the effects of longer time periods.

\subsubsection{Goal of the project}
The goal of this project is to significantly increase the computation speed of G4-STORK simulations, which should transfer well to other GEANT-4 projects. Increasing the speed will allow researchers to use more accurate models, to see the effects of longer time periods on the particles, and to generally increase their productivity. This will be achieved by porting the algorithms that currently run on the CPU to the GPU, taking advantage of the parallel power of the GPU's many cores.

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Stakeholders}\label{SubSec_Stakeholders} % Victor
The stakeholders that are currently involved with the project are:
\begin{itemize}
\item the project group
\item the supervisors of the project (Dr. Adriaan Buijs and Dr. Emil Sekerenski)
\item McMaster Engineering Physics Department, specifically grad student Wesley Ford
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{The Client}
The clients for the project are the Dr. Buijs and his grad student Wesley Ford, representing the McMaster Engineering Physics Department. The clients proposed the project because they have invested interest in running G4-STORK simulations more efficiently. They will be using the parallelized code to run and study nuclear simulations, and require that the code executes much more quickly to obtain useful data.
	
\subsubsection{The Customer}
The customer in this case also includes the clients. As such they will be the part of the end-user group that we will cater to.
The customer is also other members of the Engineering Physics department who wish to run simulations using GEANT-4 as they also have use for the end product. The users will want to run simulations with many particles and particle collisions, the optimization of the code will allow for them to do this in a timely fashion.
	
\subsubsection{Other Stakeholders}
The project group members hold stake in the successful completion of the project. If the project is done well, and the documentation is error free and concise, they are bound for high grades in their course.\\

Collaborators and GEANT-4 users external to McMaster could be potential stakeholders. If the software is successfully completed and the resulting performance improvements are significant, the changes will be submitted to the GEANT-4 repository. It is then up to the GEANT-4 group to decide if those contributions are accepted or not, and if they are then all users of GEANT-4 stand to benefit from them. However, they are not considered stakeholders throughout the development of the project, the focus is instead on those mentioned in \ref{SubSec_Stakeholders}.

\subsubsection{The Hands-On Users of the Product}
Graduate students and professors from the McMaster Engineering Physics Department will be hands-on users of the product. They will all have familiarity with the existing product. 

\subsubsection{Personas}
Consider Matt Douglas, a graduate student in the Engineering Physics Department. Matt wants to study how particles in McMaster's nuclear reactor affect each other, given some specific starting conditions, and a very large number of particles. Matt knows how to use the existing G4-STORK program, but it will take weeks to run the computations. Matt inputs his desired number of particles and specific starting conditions into a G4-STORK simulation. He enables the GPU features of the new product, and successfully runs the simulation in a reasonable amount of time. He observes interesting results that would not have been feasible to obtain with the old product.\\

\subsubsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
Priority will be given to Wesley Ford, the grad student that proposed the project to Dr. Buijs. He will be the primary user of G4-STORK as it is integral to his current research.

\section{Project Constraints}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Mandated Constraints} % Rob
There are global constraints put in place by the existing software, the stakeholders, and the structure of 4ZP6. The project must be built upon the existing GEANT-4 code, which is used by G4-STORK to run the simulation. The final product must be able to run any code/simulation that ran on the existing software. The software must run in parallel on a NVIDIA GPU. Additionally, the final product needs to be completed by the end of April, 2016. If these global constraints are not met the final product is not acceptable.\\

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Naming Conventions \& Terminology} % Stuart
Throughout the document, ``the project'', ``the product'', and/or ``the software'' all refer to the modified GEANT-4 code that will include the capability to be run on a GPU. The ``existing software'' refers to the current GEANT-4 simulation toolkit.\\

\item GEANT-4/G4-STORK run simulations on the CPU
\item Simulations run calculations on each particle independently
\item Calculations on each particle are relatively simple probabilities

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{The Scope of the Work} % Victor
\subsubsection{The Current Situation}
The project, G4-STORK, is currently at a point where it is able to run all necessary simulations, on the CPU. Currently, when the G4-STORK simulation is run with a large number of particles or over a period of several seconds it takes a lot of computation time.

\subsubsection{The Context of The Work}
\begin{figure}[h]
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{WorkContextDiagram} 
\end{figure} 

\subsubsection{Work Partitioning}
All tasks will be divided equally among all members of the development team. The team will work together to initially define the interface for using the GPU to run calculations, and once that is completed each member will independently work on porting specific classes to the GPU. Testing will be done throughout the development by the developers. This ensures that all developers are able to easily debug their contributions.

\section{Project Issues}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Open Issues} % Victor
\begin{itemize}
\item The amount of time required to speedup all classes and libraries involved in G4-STORK is unknown, feasibility of project is in question
\item The actual speedup of G4-STORK achievable is unknown it could be far less than desired
\end{itemize}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Off-the-Shelf Solutions} % Rob

\subsubsection{Ready-Made Products}
No fully-fledged solution to the given problem has been implemented and distributed. There have been attempts, however, to solving certain portions of the problem. At the Helsinki Institute of Physics (HIP) a team of three attempted to test the potential efficiency increase of porting GEANT-4 code to a GPU. They ported some small portions of GEANT-4, but determined that taking on the entire project would be difficult. Their conclusions supported the conjecture that running the code on a GPU would offer significant increases in performance.

\subsubsection{Reusable Components}
Although there is not any hard-copy code that can be reused, the team of three from HIP have published a research paper that may be used as a starting point for the current project.

\subsubsection{Products That Can Be Copied}
NA -- There are no existing products that can be copied.

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{New Problems}\label{SubSec_NewProbs} % Stuart
\subsubsection{Effects on the Current Environment}
The new product will be designed as an opt-in addition to the existing product. That is, unless manually changed by the user, the program will execute identically as before, running on the CPU. The motivation for this is to ensure compatibility, as the programming environment for GP-GPU programming is restricted to certain hardware. The current environment will not be affected by the changes unless the user specifically decides to use them.

\subsubsection{Effects on the Installed Systems}
Requirement \ref{Req_EasyChange} specifies the importance of creating a simple interface for the user to enable the changes in the new system, or revert to the previous one. Changes to the code will be isolated, and only used when they are manually enabled.

\subsubsection{Potential User Problems}
Due to the separation of the changes and the existing product, users will not negatively respond to the changes, indeed they won't even notice them unless actively looking. To use the new product's features, users will enable them and then execute the program in an identical manner to how the existing software works (requirement \ref{Req_EasyChange}).

\subsubsection{Limitations of the Anticipated Implementation Environment That May Inhibit the New Product}
To run the GP-GPU computations, specific hardware is required (recent NVIDIA graphics card).

\subsubsection{Follow-Up Problems}
There are a number of potential situations that could lead to the product failing. We are confident that we will be able to succeed, however we realize that there is a possibility of failure, and have outlined the potential causes below.
\begin{itemize}
\item Learning curve for existing G4-STORK codebase is too steep, cannot gain adequate understanding to implement changes in time constraints
\item Porting existing algorithms to CUDA requires too much work, and we are not able to run the algorithms on a GPU within time constraints
\item The current product's interface for the specific algorithms that will be ported is not well-enough defined
\item The large models used in the simulation exceed memory limitations on the GPU, and cannot be run on existing hardware
\item Performance gains from the GPU are negligible, due to the structure of the computations
\item Numerical accuracy problems lead to different results from simulations run on the existing product vs. the new product

\subsection{Migration to the New Product} % Victor

\subsubsection{Requirements for Migration to the New Product}
Once the end product has been implemented, all new projects using G4-STORK running on GPU's will use the new code.

\subsubsection{Data That Has to Be Modified or Translated for the New System}
In order to take advantage of the GPU speedup, old projects will need to be modified to use the new classes written for GPU acceleration. 

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Risks} % Rob

Because our software has research based aspirations and goals, some traditional risks are less catastrophic to the success of the project, but are still risks nonetheless. The following may pose to be potential risks:\\

\begin{itemize}
	\item Excessive schedule pressure
	\item Technical/Resource limitations
	\item Inadequate measurements
	\item Optimistic time constraints
\end{itemize}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Costs} % Stuart
All software used in the project is open-source and/or available for free. Existing hardware will be used for development, so there are no associated monetary costs.\\

We have very clear and well-defined deadlines for each deliverable, and are in full confidence that we will meet each one. The time it takes for each deliverable will be variable, but the date of completion for each is concrete, as outlined in \ref{SubSec_Tasks}.

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{User Documentation and Training} % Matt
\begin{itemize}
	\item Function descriptions shall be provided for every new function in the code
	\item There shall be a thorough Readme file accompanying the project that will explain to the user the changes as well as how to enable GPU computation
	\item Users who know how to use G4-STORK should be able to easily run it on the GPU
\end{itemize}

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Waiting Room} % Victor
There are currently no plans for extended requirements for future releases.

% ----------------------------- Sub Section ----------------------------- %
\subsection{Ideas for Solutions} % Rob
Some solutions to a few potential problems have been breifly mentioned in the above section (see \ref{SubSec_NewProbs}). Outside of those, we can resolve usability issues with a well-written user manual, which will explain how to download the software (or for previous GEANT4 users, how to upgrade).
